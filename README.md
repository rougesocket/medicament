# Medicament 
Your Medical Inventory Management System

A medical shop contains large amount of medicine spread across the store. It is difficult to not only track expiry of each product but also to check if a stock of medicine is available or not. Every year medical shop owners face huge amount of loss due to this infeasible way of handling them.

“Medicament”, an online medical inventory management system is developed with an aim to reduce the time and energy required to carry out day to day medical inventory management task in a medical shop. It provides an interactive dashboard that indicate the today’s total sale amount, transaction carried out today and total number of expiring medicines without any effort. The platform keeps a track of total stock of medicine available. It also provides a list of medicine that are expiring today. It automates the task of record maintenance in a pharmacy shop. This allows business owners to focus on strategies of market expansion and “medicament” will take of their inventory.
